Built a Cointegration Pairs Trading Model incorporating the Johansen cointegration test, OLS hedge ratio, ATR‑based stop loss, target‑volatility leverage adjustment, and multi‑stage parameter optimization. In a 6‑year back‑test, the model achieved an annualized return of 6.27%, annualized volatility of 9.21%, a Sharpe Ratio of 0.68, a Sortino Ratio of 0.78, and a maximum drawdown of –8.67%, demonstrating solid risk control.

During out‑of‑sample testing, the model performed better than during training, delivering an annualized return of 8.64% and a Sharpe Ratio of 0.80 while maintaining a stable maximum drawdown. This suggests the model was not over‑fitted and generalizes well to unseen data.

Although the annualized return of 6.27% was lower than a Buy‑and‑Hold strategy (24.32%), the strategy’s annualized volatility was only 9.21% (vs 28.74%) and maximum drawdown –8.67% (vs –40.54%), while remaining fully market‑neutral. This implies the strategy can generate alpha regardless of market direction, offering stable long‑term gains.
